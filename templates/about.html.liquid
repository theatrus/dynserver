    <h2>About theatr.us</h2> 
    
    <p>Hi, my name is Yann. I nominally do software and have done that since the
    late 1990s. I'm really good at embedded systems, Rust, C, C++, distributed
    systems, infrastructure, and have worked at various places including
    Twitter, Lyft, and Airbnb. 

    <p>I'm an expert in Observability and Reliability systems.
    <p>And I like doing hardware projects, software projects, fish (reef and fresh water), pictures (of things), and space (and pictures of space). And more importantly, the intersection of all of those.
    
    <p>Need to get in contact? Try the Contact tab.
