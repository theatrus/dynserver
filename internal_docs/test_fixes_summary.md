# Test Fixes Summary

## Problem
After implementing the cache busting feature for CSS files, tests were failing with the error:
```
Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime. This happens because a function (like `block_on`) 
attempted to block the current thread while the thread is being used to drive asynchronous tasks.
```

## Root Cause
The template rendering function was trying to use `tokio::task::block_in_place` and `block_on` to call async functions from within an already async context. This is not allowed in Tokio when you're already in an async runtime.

## Solution
Since `render_template` is already an async function, we simply awaited the async calls directly instead of trying to block:

1. **Changed from blocking calls to direct await**:
   ```rust
   // Before (incorrect):
   let style_css_url = tokio::task::block_in_place(|| {
       tokio::runtime::Handle::current().block_on(async {
           static_handler.get_versioned_url("/static/style.css").await
       })
   });
   
   // After (correct):
   let style_css_url = static_handler.get_versioned_url("/static/style.css").await;
   ```

2. **Fixed the ArrayView Send issue**:
   - The `ArrayView` from liquid is not `Send`, which caused issues when holding references across await points
   - Solution: Collect all CSS file names into a Vec<String> first, then process them asynchronously
   - This avoids holding non-Send references across await boundaries

## Key Lessons
1. When you're already in an async function, just use `.await` directly
2. Don't try to block the runtime from within an async context
3. Be careful about holding references to non-Send types across await points
4. Collect data into owned types before async operations if the source type is not Send

## Test Results
All tests now pass successfully:
- 47 unit tests passing
- 11 gallery integration tests passing
- 6 posts integration tests passing
- 4 template integration tests passing
